# protostar

Prototype application launcher for Stardust XR

Protostar provides an easy to use crate to write applications launchers. See the [examples](examples) to learn more!

# TODO:

1. Implement our own (more reliable) way to get icons
2. Untangle the code (eg: make it so that the user can decide sizes, models, etc... ) 
3. Implement [configuration files](https://docs.rs/confy/latest/confy/) in the examples
